#Creating An Array 
Here we use three methods to display the array 

1. Normal method : which uses normal for loop to display the array 

2. Enhanced For Loop method : which create an object as same as the normal array and then we will print the object 

3. Using tostring() method : which will convert the array data into string then it will print , it is a part of the java.util package
